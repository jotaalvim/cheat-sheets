Dynamic - função que muda um Behaviour quando ocorre um Event
Behavior - guarda um valor a devolver quando ha o evento
Event   - ou acontece ou não, Click, Input...

data Dynamic t :: * -> *
    A container for a value that can change over time and allows
    notifications on changes. Basically a combination of a Behavior and
    an Event, with a rule that the Behavior will change if and only if
    the Event fires.

data Event t :: * -> *
    A stream of occurrences. During any given frame, an Event is either
    occurring or not occurring; if it is occurring, it will contain a
    value of the given type (its "occurrence type")

data Behavior t :: * -> *
    A container for a value that can change over time. Behaviors can
    be sampled at will, but it is not possible to be notified when
    they change


holdDyn :: a -> Event t a -> m (Dynamic t a)
    Create a Dynamic value using the given initial value that changes
    every time the Event occurs.

updated :: Dynamic t a -> Event t a
    Extract the Event of the Dynamic.

elDynAttr :: Text -> Dynamic t (Map Text Text) -> m a -> m a
    Create a DOM element with Dynamic Attributes


mergeWith :: (a -> a -> a) -> [Event t a] -> Event t a
    Create a new Event that occurs if at least one of the Events in the list occurs. If multiple occur at the same time they are folded from the left with the given function.

accumDyn ::  (a -> b -> a) -> a -> Event t b -> m (Dynamic t a) 
    Accumulate a Dynamic by folding occurrences of an Event with the provided function. See foldDyn.

count :: Event t a -> m (Dynamic t b)
    Create a new Dynamic that counts the occurrences of the Event.



headE :: Event t a -> m (Event t a)
    Create a new Event that only occurs only once, on the first occurrence of the supplied Event.

tailE :: Event t a -> m (Event t a)
    Create a new Event that occurs on all but the first occurrence of the supplied Event.

constant :: a -> Behavior t a
    Create a Behavior that always has the given value

gate :: Behavior t Bool -> Event t a -> Event t a
    Create a new Event that only occurs if the supplied Event occurs and the Behavior is true at the time of occurrence.
