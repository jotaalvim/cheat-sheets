data Dynamic t :: * -> *
    A container for a value that can change over time and allows notifications on changes. Basically a combination of a Behavior and an Event, with a rule that the Behavior will change if and only if the Event fires.


data Event t :: * -> *
    A stream of occurrences. During any given frame, an Event is either occurring or not occurring; if it is occurring, it will contain a value of the given type (its "occurrence type")
